    "In this blog post, we'll take a deeper look into **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models** (also known as DDPMs, diffusion models, score-based generative models or simply [autoencoders](https://benanne.github.io/2022/01/31/diffusion.html)) as researchers have been able to achieve remarkable results with them for (un)conditional image/audio/video generation. Popular examples (at the time of writing) include [GLIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10741) and [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) by OpenAI, [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) by the University of Heidelberg and [ImageGen](https://imagen.research.google/) by Google Brain.\n",

Note that the idea of diffusion for generative modeling was actually already introduced in ([Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585)). However, it took until ([Song et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600)) (at Stanford University), and then ([Ho et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)) (at Google Brain) who independently improved the approach.\n",

This network, like any autoencoder, consists of a bottleneck in the middle that makes sure the network learns only the most important information.

    "\n",
    "- Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models ([Nichol et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672)): finds that learning the variance of the conditional distribution (besides the mean) helps in improving performance\n",
    "- Cascaded Diffusion Models for High Fidelity Image Generation ([Ho et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15282)): introduces cascaded diffusion, which comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that generate images of increasing resolution for high-fidelity image synthesis\n",
    "- Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis ([Dhariwal et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233)): show that diffusion models can achieve image sample quality superior to the current state-of-the-art generative models by improving the U-Net architecture, as well as introducing classifier guidance\n",
    "- Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance ([Ho et al., 2021](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qw8AKxfYbI)): shows that you don't need a classifier for guiding a diffusion model by jointly training a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model with a single neural network\n",
    "- Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents (DALL-E 2) ([Ramesh et al., 2022](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-2.pdf)): uses a prior to turn a text caption into a CLIP image embedding, after which a diffusion model decodes it into an image\n",
    "- Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding (ImageGen) ([Saharia et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487)): shows that combining a large pre-trained language model (e.g. T5) with cascaded diffusion works well for text-to-image synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this list only includes important works until the time of writing, which is June 7th, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, it seems that the main (perhaps only) disadvantage of diffusion models is that they require multiple forward passes to generate an image (which is not the case for generative models like GANs). However, there's [research going on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13902) that enables high-fidelity generation in as few as 10 denoising steps."
