    "There are three steps to creating segmentation-aware convolutional nets:\n",
    "- (i) learn segmentation cues, \n",
    "- (ii) use the cues to create local foreground masks, and \n",
    "- (iii) use the masks together with convolution, to create foreground-focused convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach realizes each of these steps in a unified manner that is at once general (i.e., applicable to both discrete and continuous prediction tasks), differentiable (i.e., end-to-end trainable as a neural network), and fast (i.e., implemented as GPU-optimized variants of convolution)."

    "### Learning segmentation cues\n",
    "Given an RGB image $I$, made up of pixels $p \\in R^3$, enbedding function that maps (i.e., embeds) the pixels into a feature space where semantic similarity between pixels can be measured as a distance [11].\n",
    "We can write the embedding function as $ f: R^3 \\rightarrow R^D$, or more specifically, $f(p) = e$, where $e \\in R^D$ is the embedding for pixel $p \\in R^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to learn this function $f$ via CNN?\n",
    "- For any two pixel indices $i$ and $j$, and corresponding embeddings $e_i$, $e_j$ and object class labels $I_i$, $I_j$, we can optimize the same-label pairs to have “near” embeddings, and the different-label pairs to have “far” embeddings. \n",
    "- Using $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to denote the “near” and “far” thresholds, respectively, we can define the pairwise loss as\n",
    "$$ L_{i,j} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "        max(|| e_i - e_j|| - \\alpha, 0)  \\text{    if  } I_i = I_j \\\\\n",
    "        max(\\beta - || e_i - e_j ||, 0)  \\text{    if  } I_i \\not = I_j\n",
    "        \\end{cases},  \\text{ (1)} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "- we use $\\alpha = 0.5$, and $\\beta = 2$. In practice, the specific values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are unimportant, so long as $\\alpha \\leq \\beta$.\n",
    "- Total loss is the summation across the image, with sampling pairs from a neighborhood around each pixel, as in $$ L = \\sum_{i \\in N} \\sum_{j \\in N_i} l_{i,j} \\text{,  (2)}$$ where $j \\in N_i$ iterates over the spatial neighbors of index $i$. For example, use $ 3 \\times 3$ neighborhoods in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convert embedding distance to probabilities: **embeded mask**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert the magnitudes into (unnormalized) probabilities indicating whether or not pixels $p_i$ and $p_j$ fall on the smae object, via the exponential distribution:\n",
    "$$ m_{i,j} = \\exp(- \\lambda || e_i - e_j||)  \\text{,  (3)}$$\n",
    "- where $\\lambda$ is a learnable parameter specifying the hardness of this decision, and the notation $m_{i,j}$ denotes that $i$ is the reference pixel, and $j$ is the neighbor being considered. \n",
    "- In other words, considering all indices $j \\in N_i$ , $m_i$ represents a foreground-background segmentation mask, where the central pixel $i$ is defined as the foreground, i.e., $m_{i,i} = 1$.\n"
